Error handling basics

Diff b|w frameworks like fastapi which automatically raise errors for you
- VS -
flask or express where you must manually handle all errors

Key point: FastAPI catches exceptions and returns HTTP responses, but you decide
what status code and message to send by raising HTTPException.

If you don't catch exceptions yourself, FastAPI will:
Catch any unhandled exception
Return 500 with a generic/ugly error message - user or a fellow FE dev has no idea about what error occurred
Not rollback your database transaction (you must do this)


Since fastapi automatically handles errors for you, you don't necessarily need a try-except inside
any of your route handlers, but a better approach is that handle buisenss logic errors inside the service
layer and HTTP errors (HTTPException) inside the route handlers

i handled a buiseness logic error as a ValueError in a try block and caught it inside it's counterpart
except block and raised an HTTPException for it, This was in my service layer but inside my route handler,
i still used "except Exception" which caught all exceptions including the HTTPException i myself threw
and overwrote it.
