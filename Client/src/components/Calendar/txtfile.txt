u can see the 5 components i ll mention: scheduler, calendar, calendarheader, calendarbody, and clinicView, i did the prop drilling intentionally, i did use react.memo, use memo, use callback and i can see performace improvements but i'd like a better intuition, here's what i'd like first: why these are necessary in the js context (i.e function references, identities new creations, etc), then transition to react and why it matters in context to react's render mechanism and cycle
