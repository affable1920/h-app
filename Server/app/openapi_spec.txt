Generating an openapi spec on the client
Openapi requires each path operation to have a unique identifier across all path operations.

Openapi does this by using teh following naming convention:
Function name   path operation name   path params name (if any)   and the HTTP method after that

e.g for the get_doctors method, the openapi spec name for the function would be:

func_name___pth_nam_param_nam_HTTP_methodname
get_doctors_doctors_doctor_id_get

We can use tags inside our route methods to seperate models on the client
